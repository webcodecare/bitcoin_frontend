# ðŸš€ Quick Deployment Fix

## The Problem

You're getting 404 errors because your `frontend_new` and `backend_new` are separate projects, but the frontend is trying to make API calls to a backend that isn't connected.

## âœ… Quick Solution

### Option 1: Use the Main Project (Recommended)

Instead of using `frontend_new` and `backend_new` separately, use your main project:

```bash
# Use the main project for development and deployment
cd your-main-project  # Not frontend_new or backend_new
npm run dev           # This runs both frontend and backend together
```

### Option 2: Deploy Separately (If you need to use frontend_new/backend_new)

1. **Deploy Backend First:**
   ```bash
   cd backend_new
   # Deploy to Vercel/Railway/Render
   # Get your backend URL: https://your-backend-abc123.vercel.app
   ```

2. **Configure Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend_new
   # Use the setup script:
   chmod +x setup-deployment.sh
   ./setup-deployment.sh https://your-backend-abc123.vercel.app
   ```

3. **Deploy Frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   vercel --prod  # Or your preferred deployment method
   ```

## ðŸ”§ What I Fixed

- âœ… Fixed API configuration inconsistencies
- âœ… Updated chart components to use proper API URLs
- âœ… Created environment files for different deployment scenarios
- âœ… Updated vercel.json with proper backend URL
- âœ… Added deployment automation script

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

### Local Development Works âœ…
- Backend runs on port 5000
- Frontend runs on port 3000
- API calls are proxied correctly
- Real-time data updates working

### Deployment Ready âœ…
- Environment variables configured
- API endpoints use centralized configuration
- Vercel.json configured for API rewrites
- Setup script automates backend URL configuration

## ðŸ“± Usage Examples

### For Quick Testing Locally
Use the main project instead of frontend_new/backend_new folders.

### For Production Deployment
1. Deploy backend first
2. Run `./setup-deployment.sh https://your-backend-url`
3. Deploy frontend

That's it! Your 404 errors should be resolved. ðŸŽ‰
