# üöÄ VERCEL DEPLOYMENT - FINAL SOLUTION

## ‚ùå PERSISTENT ISSUE

**Problem**: Vercel continues to auto-detect as Next.js despite configuration
**Root Cause**: Vercel's auto-detection is overriding manual configuration

## ‚úÖ COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION

### Option 1: Use Vercel Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find your project**: crypto-kings-frontend
3. **Go to Settings > General**
4. **Change Framework Preset**: 
   - Current: "Next.js" 
   - Change to: "Other" or "Vite"
5. **Build & Output Settings**:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`
6. **Environment Variables** (Settings > Environment Variables):
   - Add: `VITE_API_BASE_URL` = `https://bitcoin-api.solvemeet.com`
7. **Redeploy**: Go to Deployments > click "..." > Redeploy

### Option 2: Delete and Recreate Project

```bash
# Delete current project from Vercel dashboard, then:
cd frontend_new
vercel --name crypto-kings-frontend-v2
# During setup, choose "Other" as framework
```

### Option 3: Use Alternative Platform

**Netlify Deployment** (Works immediately with Vite):
```bash
cd frontend_new
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to Netlify
# Set environment variable: VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://bitcoin-api.solvemeet.com
```

**Railway Deployment**:
```bash
cd frontend_new
# Connect to Railway
railway login
railway link
railway up
```

## üìù UPDATED CONFIGURATION

### vercel.json (Updated)
```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "handle": "filesystem"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "VITE_API_BASE_URL": "https://bitcoin-api.solvemeet.com"
  }
}
```

### package.json (Added vercel-build script)
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "vercel-build": "vite build"
  }
}
```

## üéØ EXPECTED RESULT

After using **Option 1** (Dashboard):
- ‚úÖ Vercel recognizes as Vite project
- ‚úÖ Uses correct build command
- ‚úÖ Environment variables properly set
- ‚úÖ API calls route to bitcoin-api.solvemeet.com
- ‚úÖ No more Next.js detection errors
